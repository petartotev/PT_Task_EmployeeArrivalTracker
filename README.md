        - https://localhost:7168
    - **webappclient** - a new FE React app which fetches data from WebAppServer and visualizes it in a table

## Solution Startup

### 1. Run **WebService** (existing "3rd party" app) - http://localhost:51396/
- You should have the web service running locally on **port 51396**.

### 2. Execute this query in SqlServer which builds an empty database:
```
CREATE DATABASE [EmployeeArrivalTracker]
GO
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WebAppServer uses Hangfire, which needs an existing database to work with.

### 3. Run **WebAppServer** (BE Web API server) - https://localhost:7168/
- First, WebAppServer either builds a database using DbUp + predefined SQL scripts or skips this step in case scripts have already been executed
- Next, if database is empty (initial run), WebAppServer seeds test data from */Data/employees.json* provided by Fourth in the requirements repo
- Next, WebAppServer invokes a *Singleton service 'SubscriptionHandler'* which:
    - builds a http client that calls WebService to subscribe to it. The token from response is stored in-memory. It is later used as a source-of-truth for incoming data.
        - In case WebService responds with 500 (Internal Server Error), Polly is used in order to retry 5 times, exponentially. 
    - schedules a **single Hangfire job** for 00:05 AM next day which triggers a **recurring Hangfire job**.  
    - üí° Every day at 07:00 AM the **recurring Hangfire job** invokes a function which calls WebService and resubscribes to it. The new token from response overrides the old.
- Finally, you should have a server running locally on **port 7168** and see data incoming from WebService in the Serilog console!

### 4. Run **webappclient** (FE React Client) - http://localhost:3000/
- ‚ö†Ô∏è First, make sure you have the latest *Node Package Manager (npm)* and the latest LTS version of *node.js* installed (v16.16.0 at the time of writing)
```
nvm install 16.16.0
nvm use 16.16.0
```
- Open cmd.exe as admin from *..\EmployeeArrivalTracker\src\webappclient* or open the folder in Visual Studio Code and use its Terminal.  
Next, execute the following commands in order to build and run the client:
```
npm install
npm audit fix --force
npm start
```
- Finally, you should have a client running locally on port 3000!

## Comments

### **WebService (3rd party provider)**

Comments on **JsonEmployeeGenerator** are written down in the Program.cs file of the console application, inline.

### **WebAppServer (BE server)**

#### **CORS**
Unfortunately, webappclient had failed to call WebAppServer due to CORS issues. That is why in the Startup.cs of the web server I have let the use of CORS.  
‚ö†Ô∏è This could be a security issue so it needs further investigation.

#### **Tests**
‚ö†Ô∏è The 60 unit tests introduced don't claim to cover all logic!  
Nevertheless, these are enough for one to check the libraries used (NUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq) and the AAA structure.

### **webappclient (FE client)**

#### **Sorting / Ordering / Paging**
Filtering that was implemented allows selections by:
- 'from date'
- 'to date'
- 'order' (ascending / descending)
- 'page count'  

üí° It would be user friendly to also introduce filtering by 'employee', 'role', 'manager'.  
Unfortunatelly, I didn't find the time to implement this yet.

## Requirements

As a team we are in charge of a new development for the company:

Create a reporting tool that will provide information on a table with data about the time employees arrive to the building.

This Web Application MUST subscribe to a WebService (provided in the solution already) to do the following:
- Receive and store information about a bus stop located in front of the company's office.
- Allow a user to see a report with the received information

In order to subscribe to the service, compile the solution, and run the project WebService in the background

Send a request to the endpoint

`http://localhost:51396/api/clients/subscribe?date=2016-03-10&callback={URI}`

with the (*MANDATORY*) header:

`Accept-Client: "Fourth-Monitor"`

with the (*MANDATORY*) parameters:

`date`: date of the required simulated data in the format yyyy-MM-dd

`callback`: url where the webservice will submit the data

Possible responses:

`401 unauthorized`

`200 Ok` // with a body

`{
	"Token":"XXX",
	"expires":"DATE" //ISO 8601 format
}`

If the response status is 200:

The service will start sending requests to provided callback in the url, until it fails after 10 retries or the simulation is finished for the provided date (all the information for that date has been submited)
Every request will contain a header X-Fourth-Token with the provided token, and this has to be validated in order to receive valid submissions of data, header must exist and be the same as the one in the response to the subscription.

The callback has to accept POST messages receiving the following json list

`{
	[  { "EmployeeId" : X , "When" : "2016-04-01T14:35:20Z" }	]
}`

- *EmployeeId*: int
- *When*: DateTime valid ISO 8601 format

*It is required to pass the test that you*

- Fork the master branch.
- Introduce changes implementing the following
    - A database to store the information (Employees and Arrival information)
    - The Web Application to connect to the webservice, and accept information about the employees arriving to the bus stop.
     - Every time the WebService makes a request to your application save the information in the database
     - Create a web page where the information is presented in a table to the user (allow filtering/sorting)
- If required add any comments in a file in the Comments folder.

- In the folder Comments create 1 file (MANDATORY) with

	A review of the code of the JsonEmployeeGenerator, proposing changes inline the code to improve the code quality and performance

- Create another file with (THIS IS A BONUS, NOT MANDATORY):

Make a proposal of an architectural change of the WebService to improve reliability

Unit tests will be considered as advantage
